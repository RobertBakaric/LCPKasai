LCPKasai version 1.0
=======================

FULL NAME:

Lowest Common Prefix Computatioin Tool (Kasai et al. [3])


DESCRIPTION:

The longest common prefix (LCP) array is an auxiliary data structure 
to the suffix array. The array containes lengths of the longest common 
prefixes (LCPs) between all pairs of consecutive suffixes in a sorted 
suffix array. The package contains the encapsilated sais-light-2.4.1 
library written by Yuta Mori [1] implementing the induced sorting [2] 
based suffix array construction algorithm and a C++ implementation of 
Kasai's linear time LCP construction algorithm [3].



SYNOPSIS:

    #include<vector>
    #include<string>
    #include<SuffixArray.hpp>
    #include<LCPArrayKasai.hpp>

    string text("This is my text");
  

/* Make SuffixArray */

    /* Construction */
    SuffixArray<int|long|unsigned|double> SA(text);
    /*  OR  */
    SuffixArray<int|long|unsigned|double> SA;
    SA.make(text);
    
/* Get Suffix Array */

   vector<int|long|unsigned|double>SArray = SA.GetSuffixArray();    // [15 4 7 10 0 12 1 2 5 8 3 6 14 11 13 9]

/* Compute LCP array */
   
   LCPArrayKasai<int|long|unsigned|double> LCP(SArray);
   
/* Get LCP Array */
   
   vector<int|long|unsigned|double>LCPArray = LCP.GetLCPArray();   //[]

CONSTRUCTION AND RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:

For: 

|S| - input string size

    The algorithm runs in O(|S|) worst-case time
